To forward traffic from an EC2 instance to your local machine using AWS SSM (Session Manager), you can use Session Manager Port Forwarding without needing SSH access. This setup allows you to securely connect to services on the EC2 instance (e.g., a web server) and access them from your local machine.

Steps to Forward Traffic

Step 1: Install AWS CLI v2 on your local machine
aws --version

Step 2. Install Session Manager Plugin
curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/mac_arm64/sessionmanager-bundle.zip" -o "sessionmanager-bundle.zip"

unzip sessionmanager-bundle.zip

sudo ./sessionmanager-bundle/install -i /usr/local/sessionmanagerplugin -b /usr/local/bin/session-manager-plugin

type session-manager-plugin

Step 3. IAM Role Permissions for EC2 Instance
Attach AWS managed policy: AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore

{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "ssm:StartSession",
        "ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation",
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ssm:DescribeSessions",
        "ssm:SendCommand"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
}

Step 4. IAM Permissions for Your Local User
Ensure your AWS IAM User or role has access to SSM:

{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "ssm:StartSession",
        "ssm:DescribeSessions"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
}

Step 5. Start Port Forwarding Using SSM
Run the following AWS CLI command to forward traffic (Change port number as per requirement):

aws ssm start-session \
  --target i-0bae722d82740f1e8 \
  --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession \
  --parameters '{"portNumber":["8080"],"localPortNumber":["8080"]}'

Step 6. Access the Forwarded Traffic
After running the above command, you can access the service from your local machine:
http://localhost:8080

Traffic will be securely forwarded from your local machine to the target EC2 instance.
